Portfolio with commentaries where I have learned the following:

    ThreeJS - a 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
    React Three Fiber - a library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
    TailwindCSS - a utility-first CSS styling framework
    Framer Motion - a library used to bring your React website to life with animations 

With this project, I have been able to:
    Load, create and customize 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
    Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs)
    Implement sending emails through a form on the website
    Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance using Suspense and Preload.
